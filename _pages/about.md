Medicinal Chemistry | Organic Chemistry | Analytical Chemistry | Natural Products

Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! I'm Mohammad Firoznezhad, a passionate and dedicated researcher in the captivating realms of medicinal chemistry, analytical chemistry, and the fascinating world of natural products.

With a strong background in Medicinal chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Medicinal Plant, and Nanotechnology I have immersed myself in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation within these dynamic fields. My journey has taken me through exciting experiments, rigorous analyses, and the discovery of nature's hidden secrets.

Through this website, I invite you to join me on a voyage through the intricate landscapes of science. Explore my research, delve into the complexities of molecular structures, and uncover the wonders of compounds extracted from nature itself.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious mind, or someone simply intrigued by the intersection of science and nature, you'll find a wealth of information, insights, and discoveries here. Let's embark on this intellectual journey together.

Thank you for your interest, and I hope you enjoy your visit!


Research career potential

My overall career goal is to play an active role in the discovery and development of human therapeutic drugs. In particular, I hope to be able to establish a career as a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery because this would fulfill me not only intellectually but also give me the satisfaction of knowing that what I am doing can make a difference in the lives of others. Once obtained my Master of Science degree in Natural compound(phytochemistry) (2013, Islamic Azad University branch of Shahrekord, Iran) I did not have a clear plan of my career goal. At that time, I made a big change in my life and my family motivated me to start embracing this career and try to give my contribute to the new change in my life. I was attracted by Professor. Maria Marconi’s research at the University of Cagliari because she focuses her scientific research on the characterization and Nano capsulation of natural compound interactions on the development of Drug delivery in skin care. Under Professor Anna Maria D’Ursi’s supervision, I took my first step toward my concept of career goal by focusing my entire Ph.D. training program on the study of peptide sequence from Env glycoprotein of FIV with an antiviral target in 2018. During this time, whereas I was benefiting from the extensive scientific training and qualified academic guidance of Professors Anna Maria D’ursi and Elizabetta Orlandini, which allowed me to become a Postdoctoral fellow in her laboratory (2022), it became clear to me that it was still not enough to chase my emerging long-term career goal: Professor. So, I started to collaborate with Professor. Manconi’s group based on peptide delivery and how these compounds work on the anti-leishmania and work closely with Professor Hansen’s group at the University of Copenhagen. The overall training, I have received from Professor. Hansen and Professor. Michael Gaede’s laboratory has been outstanding; the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology at the University of Copenhagen has offered me a wealth of information, expertise, knowledge, and opportunities that are directly applicable to the drug discovery process.
Nonetheless, I recognize as well that to be competitive and successful in a very crowded job market, diversity of training is priceless and represents a must. Thus, consistent with the route I have undertaken, I would like to participate in the Postdoctoral grant to get additional training, experience, and knowledge to help me successfully transition into and move up the career ladder in the life sciences academia. The University of Copenhagen Postdoctoral grant will be useful to integrate and support the contribution to the scientific costs relating to my research plan and it will be essential for a complete and independent reintegration in the host Institute. I am sure that the coursework necessary for completing this program would not only enhance my formal understanding of the drug discovery process but also educate me in the various complicated stages of the drug development process. I would love to expand my research experiences and grow intellectually in a university atmosphere such as that of the University of Copenhagen. It is my sincere hope that the acquisition of these additional skills, in combination with the training offered by the University of Copenhagen, would properly synergize and allow me to be uniquely positioned for the pursuit of a fulfilling career as a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry, Drug Discovery, and Drug Delivery.
